# evoution-algo

Automated testing for evolution algorithms.

Exclude algorithms by moving them to `/algorithms_excluded`.

Modify parameters and choose a benchmark function in `config.py`.

Run `compare_algorithms.py` to see results.

---

Add algorithms to `/algorithms` for automated testing.

To write a new algorithm, take a look at `algorithms-excluded/template_algorithm.py` for example and instructions.
