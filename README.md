# evoution-algo

Automated testing for evolution algorithms.

Add algorithms to `/algorithms` for automated testing.

Exclude algorithms by moving them to `/algorithms_excluded`.

Select a function from `benchmark_functions.py` and import it into `compare_algorithms.py` as `current_function`.

Modify parameters in `compare_algorithms.py`.

Run `compare_algorithms.py` to see results.
